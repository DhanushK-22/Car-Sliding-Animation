# Car Sliding Animation Prototype

This project demonstrates a simple **Car Sliding Animation** prototype created using Figma. The animation shows a car moving from the left to the right side of the screen when triggered by a user interaction (such as a click or tap). The project uses Figma's **Auto Animate** and **Prototype** features to create smooth transitions and interactions.


## Features
- **Smooth Car Animation**: The car slides across the screen from left to right.
- **Interactive Prototype**: Trigger the animation with a simple tap or click.
- **Mobile/Desktop Compatibility**: Works well on both mobile and desktop devices.


## Requirements
- Figma account (Free or Paid version).
- Basic understanding of Figma's interface and prototyping tools.


## Installation

1. Clone or download the Figma prototype.
2. Open the Figma file in your Figma desktop app or browser.
3. Review the components and layers for the car object and background.
4. Test the prototype in **Prototype Mode** to see the sliding car animation in action.


### 4. Test the Animation
- Enter **Prototype Mode** and click the play button to test the animation.
